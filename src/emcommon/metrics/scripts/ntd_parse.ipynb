    "The goal of this notebook is to gather data from the National Transit Database (NTD) and parse it into something usable for our transit carbon calculations. There are two datasets we need to import and parse, one being the [NTD Annual Data - Fuel and Energy](https://data.transportation.gov/Public-Transit/2022-NTD-Annual-Data-Fuel-and-Energy/8ehq-7his/data) set, and the other being the [TS2.2 - Service Data and Operating Expenses Time Series by System](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/ts22-service-data-and-operating-expenses-time-series-system-0) set. The former gives us data on fuel types used by certain transit agencies, while the latter gives us the passenger miles traveled (PMT) of each agency. Once the notebook has ran, all of the parsed data goes into `revised-ntd-json-data.json`. The data format is as follows...\n",
