    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to gather data from the National Transit Database (NTD) and parse it into something usable for our public transit carbon calculations. The two datasets we want to use are the [NTD Annual Data - Fuel and Energy](https://data.transportation.gov/Public-Transit/2022-NTD-Annual-Data-Fuel-and-Energy/8ehq-7his/data) dataset, and the [NTD Service](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-service) dataset. The Fuel and Energy set is important as it gives us information about different fuel types used by a specific agency in terms of how much was used (gallons, kwh, etc.), and the miles they have accumulated using that fuel type. The Service data is important as it gives us PMT, passenger miles traveled, which allows us to calculate an average load of the transit system at any time. Using these two sets of data together can allow us to accurately calculate the efficiency of the mode of transit by fuel type, along with the carbon footprint of using it. \n",

Something to note is that years 2018-2021 of the Fuel and Energy data were formatted slightly different than that of 2022, so we do have to be mindful about future versions in case they decide to change the format once again. Below is the difference in the formatting of the columns between the two time frames. The current script refactors the 2018 - 2021 data to look like the 2022 one, as those keys are easier to work with in a dictionary. \n",
